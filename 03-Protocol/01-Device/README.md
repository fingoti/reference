title: Fingoti Device Commands
---

You can find below the full set of commands that our pre-programmed devices will accept, execute and respond to. Up to 8 commands can be used to build a request array to be sent to a device.

The 'device' commands can be used to read, write and/or check the properties of the device configuration.
